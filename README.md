# Customer Segmentation in Marketing with Python Project

### Case Description
To what extent does our platform’s acquisition channel influence the learning outcomes of our students?

Are there any geographical locations where most of our students discover the platform, specifically through social media platforms like YouTube or Facebook?

In this project, I am working with customer data to perform market segmentation—crucial for businesses to understand customer behavior and improve marketing efficiency. The project will involve data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, implementation of clustering algorithms, and interpretation of results. Two popular clustering techniques are used: k-means and hierarchical clustering.

In this project, I delved into the diversity of customer behavior and identify distinct segments that could be targeted with personalized marketing strategies.

## [Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (click here to see Python notebook)](./customer-segmentation-in-marketing-with-python-project.ipynb)

### Data Exploration:

We have **null values** on the minutes_watched column.

Most likely, these null values correspond to people who've entered the program, but have not seen any content.

having not seen any content is equivalent as value of 0, so it is appropriate to replace missing values with 0.

### Feature Engineering

* Create **dummy variables**:

    To perform a quantitative analysis of the groups, I created dummy variables for the region of countries and the survey answers. These are categorical answers, so having them as dummy variables makes sense.

### Data Visualization and Correlation Analysis

This analysis does not reveal strong or positive correlations within the data. So, we must employ more sophisticated learning methods to understand the relationships within the data.

By visualizing the minutes watched by the CLV, there’s little to be revealed. Apart from noticing a few outliers, we cannot conclude anything because the scale of the minutes watched vastly differs from that of the CLV. This leaves the chart looking cluttered.

A possible solution would be to remove the outliers or rescale the minutes watched to hours watched.

This scatter plot serves as an illustrative reminder that it is important to uniformly scale all features to ensure they hold equal weight during segmentation.

## [Part 2: Model Implementation (click here to see Python notebook)](./customer-segmentation-in-marketing-with-python-project.ipynb)

### Data standardization
Without standardization, the results will likely be unreliable or skewed—especially considering such a difference in magnitude regarding minutes watched versus CLV, as we saw in the scatter plot.

the standardization is done with the help of StandardScaler() from sklearn library

### Hierarchical clustering
I used Ward's method for clustering

![](/images/hierarchical.png)

The results of the algorithm point to eight separate clusters. hierarchical clustering provides us with cluster count that it deems to fit the data unlike K-means clustering that we are about to do next.

### K-means clustering
To decide on the number of clusters, I used the **"Elbow Method"** with clusters ranging from 1 to 10

random_state parameter for the K-means algorithm is set to 42

![](/images/line_chart.png)

These results **doesn't show clear result** indicating which number of clusters is best to use as with hierarchical clustering.

Here because I had **preliminary idea** of the number of clusters given from the Hierarchical Clustering, I decided to **continue with using 8 clusters** for K-means clustering

**Reasons** why k-means and hierarchical clustering might suggest different number of clusters:
1. **Different methodologies.**
1. **Initial setup sensitivity:** K-means is highly sensitive to initial starting conditions. Different runs give different results. Hierarchical clustering is deterministic and will always provide the same result with the same data.
1. **Cluster shape:** K-means works best with spherical and evenly sized clusters. Hierarchical clustering does not have these assumptions.




## [Part 3: Model Evaluation and Results (click here to see Python notebook)](./customer-segmentation-in-marketing-with-python-project.ipynb)

I grouped the data by segments and aggregate the features

![](/images/analysis.png)

**Note!**

* Region_0 - **Anglo-Saxon** - USA, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia
* Region_1 - **WE** - Western Europe
* Region_2 - **World** - Rest of the world

![](/images/segmentation_k_means.png)

**Note!**

It is clearer to draw conclusions based on the table rather from the graph, but the graph is stil useful to see the **spread of the data** for one or two labels if needed. All 8 clusters in one graph seems to be too mixed up! For example we can see the data distribution for two segments:

![](/images/segmentation_k_means_sliced.png)

Based on that information, we can formulate the following clusters.
* Segment 0 – **Instagram Explorers** (289 Observations): These customers are from all regions, with a slightly larger group from the rest of the world. They discovered the platform through Instagram and have a relatively **moderate level of engagement and expenditure**.
* Segment 1 – **LinkedIn Networkers** (391 Observations): This segment consists entirely of customers from the rest of the world who have heard about your platform via LinkedIn. They have a **high level of engagement but slightly lower spending**.
* Segment 2 – **Friends' Influence** (424 Observations): This group primarily comprises customers from the rest of the world who discovered the platform through friends. They have **high engagement and moderate spending**.
* Segment 3 – **Google-YouTube Mix** (939 Observations): These customers from the rest of the world discovered the platform via a mix of Google and YouTube. They have very **high engagement and moderate spending**.
* Segment 4 – **Anglo-Saxon Multi-Channel** (1055 Observations): This segment includes customers from the US, Canada, The UK, and Australia who discovered the platform through a mix of Google, YouTube, and LinkedIn. They have **high engagement and higher-than-average spending**.
* Segment 5 – **European Multi-Channel** (372 Observations): These customers are from Western Europe and heard about the platform from various sources, including Google, YouTube, LinkedIn, and friends. They have **high engagement and the highest spending level**.
* Segment 6 – **Twitter Devotees** (58 Observations): This small group of customers discovered the platform via Twitter. They’re from all regions, with a majority from the rest of the world. They have the **lowest engagement but moderate spending**.
* Segment 7 – **Facebook Followers** (306 Observations): This group mainly heard about the platform from Facebook. They are from all regions but predominantly from the rest of the world. They have the **highest level of engagement and moderate spending**.

## [Part 4: Data Interpretation (click here to see Python notebook)](./customer-segmentation-in-marketing-with-python-project.ipynb)

Finally, I am going to interpret the customer segments from a marketing perspective. We should discuss these results with the marketing team and help employ a viable **marketing strategy**.

We should go through the different segments and analyze the channels through which customers visited the platform and their regions. 

These are the **questions** we try to answer with our analysis:
* Are there segments that attract engaged students with high Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)?
* From which channels do these segments originate, and which regions do they come from?

**Note:** Assume that the current marketing spend is **equally** allocated across all customer outreach methods and regions.

Based on these insights, the marketing team will be able to devise strategies for:

* **New Customer Outreach Method:** Identify the best channels for approaching each region.
* **Channels Performance Analysis:** Identify underperforming channels.

### Segments: 
1. **Twitter Devotees:** This smallest segment, with only 58 observations, shows that efforts on Twitter are largely ineffective. We recommend minimizing spending and resources on Twitter due to its recent instability and **the marketing team should consider early adoption of new platforms like Threads.**

1. **Facebook Users:** Although not the largest segment (around 8% of customers) and having lower average spending, Facebook users are highly dedicated to learning, with an impressive average watch time of over 2,700 minutes. This segment is diverse, with nearly a third from the US, Canada, or the UK, and over 60% from the rest of the world. **Further analysis on engagement could reveal why this group is so motivated to study.**

    **In terms of countries,** it’s a mixed bag, with a little under a third from the US, Canada, or United Kingdom and over 60% from the rest of the world. It would be worth exploring how these students interact with the platform and why their group is more motivated to study. But this would be the focus of a different analysis on engagement.

### Performance by region:
1. **Anglo-Saxon Region:** This region shows the **best performance**, as **the largest customer segment** mainly comes from the USA, Canada, the UK, and Australia. 
1. **The Google-YouTube mix** is particularly effective being **the second largest segment**, attracting over 900 customers.
1. **Western Europe:** This region has the **fewest customers** despite our assumption of having equal marketing spending across regions. However, it has the highest **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**, indicating that improving marketing efforts here is essential.
Rest of the World: This is the second-largest area, with LinkedIn being the most successful channel, followed by Facebook.

### CLV: 
1. **Anglo-Saxon and European Multichannel:** These regions have the highest-paying clusters. Effective channels include Google, YouTube, and LinkedIn. **Increasing spending on these channels in these regions is recommended due to their high CLV.**
1. **Other Regions:** LinkedIn should be the primary channel for attracting customers, followed by Facebook, due to its excellent reach and popularity.

**Based on this analysis, focus on successful channels for each region, increase spending where CLV is highest, and reconsider underperforming platforms to optimize marketing efforts.**
